<!-- 
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
This was turned in late, and by that time there was no one left to pair with. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes I liked being able to design in small steps so that I could focus on the skeleton of what the user experience would be.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
A good wireframe efficiently expresses the layout of the page you are designing.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I have never used <aside> before this!
