		<h1> Recursion Explained</h1>
		<h3> 4/4/2016 </h3>
		<p>  Recursion simply defined is when a function or method calls itself within the block. Defining it might make it seem simple, but it's easy to get confused while working with them. The case system helps organize our thoughts and intentions. The base case within a resursive function is the case where the function no longer needs to call itself. A recursive function without a base case will never terminate and call itself until the end of the time. The recursive case is whenever the function does call itself. If writing a recursive method it's a good idea to know what your base case and your recursive case will be. </p>

		<p> Recursion is usually used where the task can be split into a repetitive sub-task. The first method I wrote using recursion was a function to find the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all whole numbers decending to 1 from your input. This tequnique is useful durring this task because you need to do the same thing over and over. For each step you need to decrement by one, multiply and store the result. You do this every step until the number you're muliplying by is 1. This is the base case in the situation. At this point the function will no longer call itself and can terminate with a result. </p>
