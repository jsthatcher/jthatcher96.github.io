		<h3> 3:14pm 3/8/2016 </h3>
       <p> Since the first day I became involved in the computer science community I've been aware of the lack of diversity within the industry. Six years ago, when I was first starting highschool there had already been a push to get more women and people of color into STEM programs. My classrooms had very different racial demographics than any tech company today, and spoke a great deal about why under-represenation in tech matters.
       </p>

       <p>Today we see companies setting diversity goals, and organizations giving incentives for under-represented people to get involved with tech. The problem is still present, but has gotten a good deal of publicity and the industry has absoultely responded. As my generation joins the workforce I'm confident that diversity will become less of an issue or at least from what I've seen. Let's see!
