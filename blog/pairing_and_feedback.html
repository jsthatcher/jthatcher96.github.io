		<h1> Pairing and Feedback</h1>
		<h3> 11:16pm 3/14/2016 </h3>
       <p> Pairing with people has been very interesting for me. I've been so surprised by how much it speeds up the coding process. Mistakes are caught much faster, and solutions are easier to find with two people thinking about the problem in different ways. I've enjoyed each of my sessions with other students. The best is probably just meeting people that are having as much fun as me doing these assignments. Coding proportionally was a pretty small part of my education in the past, but now it's all I do! My last session was probably the most diffucult. When it first began it seemed like we would have a hard time communicating and I had heard from others that the assignment had taken them way longer than the usual hour. It turned out even with a couple communication mistakes we finished on time. I've been getting way better and giving instructions and saying precisely what I mean.</p>
<br>
       <p> Looking back at feedback I recieved gave me a good deal to think about. I can't believe I've paired with so many people already! It's really nice to see that I've been improving over this time as well. Some people who worked with me twice even said that the second time through I was way more confident the second time around. One comment said I should make sure to make it clear who I'm addressing durring the GPS, and one asked me to speak slower. I'll definitely keep this in mind now, especially since I know I can start to stutter in stressfull situaltions. Pairing has been the best part of Phase 0 so far.</p>
