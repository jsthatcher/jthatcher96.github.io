      <h4> What are the benefits of version control? </h4>
	  <p>
        Version control is incredibly usefull especially in the software development world. Because it allows you to view the entire histrory of a document, backing up is much easier. Version control nto only allows you to see that changes but allows you to see who made the changes, when they made the changes, and why they made the changes. When colaborating on code version controll couldn't be any more usefull.
      </p>
      <h4>
          How does git help you keep track of changes? </h4>
      <p>
          Git is a version control system. It allows you to keep track of the histroy of your project. Whenever you add and commit changes it saves what your document looks like. These are stored and you are able to go back to privious versions of your text.
      </p>
      <h4>
         Why use GitHub to store your code? </h4>
      <p>
         Github allows you to store your backups in the cloud, lets you browse your project history, and allows you to share your code with other people. While git organizes the history of your files, GitHub actually allows you to browse it in a astheticly pleasing and organized way.
