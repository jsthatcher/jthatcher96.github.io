		<h1> Arrays and Hashes</h1>
		<h3> 11:12am 3/7/2016 </h3>
		<p> In Ruby, arrays and hashes are used to store sets of variables, and can be accessed through a single variable. As we work with more information these are going to become increasingly useful. They don't only make transfering information more efficient, but the functions built into them allow them to be modified in many different ways. The most important difference to note between these two structures is that arrays can only hold a single type of variable, but a hash can hold multiple.  </p>

       <p> This difference makes hashes more usefull when storing a more diverse body of information, and arrays more usefull when storing large lists of a single type of variable. The way you access items within a hash is much more discriptive, and lets you handpick it by keyword. This means I can get access to a variable by simply knowing what hash it's within, and what type of information. Because of this flexibility, hashes allow more organization when working with a diverse set of variables. If I needed to keep track of a group of peoples names, ages, occupations, and salaries I would use a hash to store each persons info. If needed to keep track of the number of people that entered a store everyday, I would use a array.</p>
