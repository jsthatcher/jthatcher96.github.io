       <p> It took me a couple seconds to get my head around what the method group_by returns, and how you use it, but after you use it a couple times it's quite clear. The group_by method takes a single array argument; this is what you pass in. The method then iterates through each element evaluating their new value acording to what the user put in the block, and then organzies them according to the result. For example the method 
       [0,1,2,3,4,5,6].group_by { |i| i%2} would return what values are even (0,2,4,6) and what values are odd(1,3,5), or which have a remainder of 0 or a remainder of 1.

<!-- 
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
This was turned in late, and by that time there was no one left to pair with. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes I liked being able to design in small steps so that I could focus on the skeleton of what the user experience would be.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
A good wireframe efficiently expresses the layout of the page you are designing.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I have never used <aside> before this!
