       <p>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding? </p>
       <p> All three of these can be used to space your website creatively. The margin of an object
       refers to the space surrounding it. Margin's don't have a color or style, they're just empty space. A border immidiately surrounds the object. It CAN be seen and may have different styles, colors, and thickness. Padding separates the inside of the object from whatever else is in there (like a text box). It changes how tightly the outside object surrounds the inside.

<!-- 
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
This was turned in late, and by that time there was no one left to pair with. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes I liked being able to design in small steps so that I could focus on the skeleton of what the user experience would be.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
A good wireframe efficiently expresses the layout of the page you are designing.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I have never used <aside> before this!
